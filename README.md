# YoutubeMusicClone
This is a project I made that works like YouTube Music. You can play songs and explore a mini music library with a cool-looking user interface. I built everything using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Features added:- 
1. Music playback with play/pause and volume control
2. Clean layout for both desktop and mobile view
3. Custom scrollbars and hover effects to make it look nice
4. Responsive design that adjusts based on screen size
5. Seekbar that updates with the music

Features that may be added in future:-
1. Adaptive background based on the cover image of the song or playlist
